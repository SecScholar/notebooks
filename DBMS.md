A Database management system (DBMS) is software that allows users to define, manipulate, retrieve, and manage data stored in a database. The following table describes the four most popular DBMSs. While they all function similarly, it's important that you have a basic understanding of each in order to choose the most appropriate DBMS to meet your needs.

|DBMS|Description|
|---|---|
|Microsoft SQL Server|Microsoft SQL Server is a proprietary relational database management system developed by Microsoft. It was released in 1989.  <br>  <br>It is a database server that supports transaction processing, business intelligence, disaster recovery, and analytic applications. As an enterprise software solution, it provides robust security and protection for a company's databases.|
|Oracle Database|Oracle Database is a highly-scalable, robust, industry-standard DBMS. It was released in 1980 by Oracle Corporation. It is commonly trusted by larger companies to manage and secure enterprise databases.  <br>  <br>Oracle continually provides software updates to maintain a high quality product. Oracle DB supports more programming languages than Microsoft SQL Server and MySQL.|
|MySQL|MySQL is an open-source DBMS that was originally released in 1995. Oracle acquired the technology and now owns and maintains MySQL. Many people who manage their own websites and databases prefer to use MySQL because it provides SQL database implementation that works well for small to medium websites.|
|Microsoft Access|Microsoft Access is a DBMS developed by Microsoft that works effectively to create and manage small relational databases with a few users. It was released in 1992 as part of Microsoft's Office suite.  <br>  <br>Access databases are composed of four kinds of database objects: tables, queries, forms, and reports. An advantage to using Access is that it is easy to set up and can be a great introduction to relational databases for inexperienced users.|

Database management systems can be evaluated and compared based on a number of different factors, including:

- Number of concurrent users supported.
- Scalability as databases expand.
- Speed of access.
- Support for different data types.
- Programming language support.
