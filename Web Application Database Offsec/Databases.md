Web apps use back end databases to store various content and info related to the web app. This means:
- Images and Files

- PII like Usernames and Passwords

# Relational Databases
These types of databases store data in tables, rows, and columns. 
*Each table can have unique keys, which can link tables together.*
These contain columns like:
- id
- username
- first_name
- last_name
***id*** can be used as a table key. Another table, **posts**, may contain posts made by all users, with columns like id, user_id, date, content, and so on.
