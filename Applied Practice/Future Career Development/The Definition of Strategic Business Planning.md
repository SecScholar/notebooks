# Competitive Position
Strategic business planning is essential to being a competitive organization in the modern day economy. Being comprised of actions that a business takes to compete aggressively, strategies help expand customer base and operate under efficient and productive standards.
It establishes a "game plan" for the management team to address competitive challenges. This involves analyzing competitors' weaknesses and designing marketing strategies to capitalize on them, positioning the company with a superior mix of products and services. It also ensures the company avoids wasting resources in areas where competitors already have strong market dominance
# Accurately Forecasts Future (prep)
"The strategic plan helps a company predict what its best opportunities are for growth -- the ideal target customers, the best markets to serve." (Hill, 2010) 
*This is all about the company forecasting the expected growth in specific business sectors.*
The plan aids in identifying the best opportunities for growth, including ideal target customers and optimal markets to serve. It helps forecast growth in current business sectors and identify new markets for entry. This forecasting ability prevents strategic errors, such as investing heavily in markets that prove to be insignificant or unprofitable.
# Provides Performance Measures
A strategic plan should provide management with quantifiable goals, and projected revenues and expenses. These can then be compared against actual financial results to assess performance. It helps identify which products, services, and markets are most profitable and which are under-performing. This also includes **contingency planning**, where alternative strategies are prepared in case originals are ineffective.
# Efficient Resource Allocation
The plan offers a logical framework for making decisions about allocating capital, time, people, and productive capacity. Managers must justify expenditures and , if possible, quantify their likely financial benefits. Resources can be reallocated to more productive uses if current expenditures cannot be justified.
# Long-Term Objectives
 Strategic planning compels managers to look beyond daily challenges and focus on long-range vision for business growth. It involves envisioning continuous growth and market share gains, then determining the sequence of strategic actions and resources required to achieve these goals.
# Creation of a Planning Culture 
When business owners conduct the planning process enthusiastically and acknowledge contributions, it can transform the company into one where strategic planning is an ongoing activity, not just an annual project. This inspires managers to operate their areas more efficiently, spot emerging market opportunities, and foster innovation, promoting a forward-looking mindset daily.

# **SWOT Analysis** 
is a tool that businesses commonly use as a part of developing their strategies. While not explicitly stated as a direct component of a "strategic business plan", its role in strategy development suggests it can contribute to planning process described. SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.
- **Strengths** refer to advantages a business has, what it does better than others, and its unique skills and experiences. (Ask your self what your organizations strengths are)
- **Weaknesses** are tasks avoided due to lack of confidence, negative work habits, or what others perceive as short comings. (Ask your self what your organizations weaknesses are)
- **Opportunities** are ways to leverage strength or eliminate weaknesses, or future developments within the organization that could be beneficial. (Look for future opportunities that could assist in strategic development)
- **Threats** are obstacles , problems caused by weaknesses, or competition from colleagues. (Correlate weaknesses and strengths with possible threats)
*By analyzing these four areas, a business can decide on actions to minimize threats and take advantage of opportunities.* Creating a to-do list based on these four areas can help us perform a swot analysis.
