These two vulnerabilities are different than each other. If you're looking for bugs to get started, these are the perfect starting point for bug bounty hunters seeing as how that automated scanners will struggle to identify these.
	**Hard to Automate**
They are not typically fun or easy to exploit. Attack Vectors are contextual to the app. Simply fuzzing parameters won't help identify IDORs or AC Bypass.
	**Not the most fun**
These are not big bugs that pay out a lot of money, they do not yield a lot of reward unless you invest in them. Most researchers love to test for injection vulnerabilities and get that rush when they get an alert or get a hit on SQL MAP. IDors and AC Bypass forces the researcher how the app works, take detailed notes and meticuliously test every mechanism one by one. 
	**Easily Demonstrate Impact**
With most web apps today being hosted in the cloud, unauthorized access to customer data is much more impactful than using a RCE to gain a foothold.
