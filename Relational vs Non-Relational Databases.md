**Relational Database**
A relational database is one that forms relations between tables that store data on specific entities. A relational data base uses structured query language.
**Pros**
 - Simple
 - Data accuracy
 - Easy access to data
 - Data Integrity
 - Flexibility
 - Security
**Cons**
- Possible performance issues.
- Set-Up can be long.
- No support of complex data types.
**Examples**
- MySQL  
	 **Pros**
	- Performance monitoring
	- Supported across major pc platforms.
	- Password encryption
	- Great performance of up to 50 million data rows.
     **Cons**
	- Slow data traction
	- Weak debugging algorithms
- Microsoft SQL Server
	  **Pros**
	- In memory analytics
	- BI semantic model
	- Customization Capabilities
	- Integration with oracle databases
	- Error management
	 **Cons**

	- Multi-Os support
      **Cons**
      - High Price
      - Difficult to find developers
      - Not easy to learn and use
  - IBM DB2
	  **Pros**
	- Powerful SQL modification
	- Efficient memory handling
	- Support of IBM infrastructure
	  **Cons**
	- Requires add-ons to unlock full functionality
	- Free support for onl

**Non-Relational Database**
A non-relational databases is a one that is more flexible because the data on the object is not limited to the same table. These databases use columns and rows to enter their values and identify objects with keys.
**Pros**
- Handling unstructured data
- Agility
- Readability
- Open-Source
**Cons**
- Dependency on a specific database management system.
- Limited functionality
- Hiring DI
**Examples**
- Mongodb
	 **Pros**
	- Support of various data types
	- Ability to distribute data automatically between different servers
	- Fast performance
	 **Cons**
	- Requires more memory increasingly
	- No control of duplication
	- Lack of documentation
- DocumentDB
		**Pros**
	- Integration with MongoDB
	- Database Migration
	- Monitoring capabilities
	- Automatic updates
	- Automatic storage increases
	  **Cons**
	- No control for duplication
	- Scarce educational resources
	- The database isn't organized well
- Cassandra
     **Pros**
     - Scalability
     - Support of Unstructured, Structured, and Semi-Structured data
     - Support for multiple data centers
     **Cons**
